      <h2> Concepts learned</h2>
<div class="question">What are the key concepts/things I learned in this course?(Exercises, Structured Enquiry, Case study)</div>
      <div class="answer"><p><b>Time Complexity Analysis: </b>I understood how to determine the efficiency of an algorithm in relation to the time it takes to run with increasing size of its input. The process taught me how big O notation works and means of determining time complexity related to various algorithms- such as those involving loops, recursion, and nested structures.<br><br>
        <b>Binary Search Trees (BSTs):</b> I learned the structure and properties of a binary search tree. The operations that I learned involved insertion, deletion, search, as well as different types of traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder). In addition, the balancing of BSTs; for example, AVL trees and Red-Black trees and their importance in maintaining optimal search times.<br><br><b>Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS):</b>
The two most important graph traversal algorithms are DFS and BFS, which visit every vertex and edge of a graph in two possibly different orders. I also saw their applications over a number of problems such as finding connected components, topological sorting, finding shortest paths to name a few.<br><br>
        <b>Heap:</b> I understood about the heap data structure, which is a specialized tree-based configuration following the heap property. I also came to know about different classifications of heaps: min-heap and max-heap, with their respective applications in priority queues and heap sorting methodologies.<br><br>
        <b>Sorting:</b> I learned about several algorithms for sorting. These include comparison-based sorts like bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quicksort, as well as non-comparison-based sorts like counting sort and radix sort. I have understood their time and space complexities , when and where to use them .<br><br><b>
        Pattern Detection:</b> I learned about algorithms pertaining to detection of the presence of any given pattern in a larger text. It included basic string searching algorithms and more complex algorithms like Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) and Boyer-Moore.<br><br><b>
        Graph Algorithms:</b> I was exposed to numerous algorithms that one can use for solving problems involving graphs, which include shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford algorithms; minimum spanning tree algorithms like Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms; and network flow algorithms.

        <h2>Time Complexity Analysis</h2>
        <div class="question">Learning/Understanding Challenges:</div>
        <div class="answer">At first, the formal definitions for Big O, Big Omega, and Big Theta notations were a bit unclear to me. The challenges arose while analyzing nested loops and recursive functions precisely, especially for problems with multiple variables or intricate control flow. Similarly, it was rather difficult for me to understand the differences among various complexity classes and the rates of their growth.</div>

        <div class="question">Challenges in Correlating with Real-World Applications: </div>
        <div class="answer">Although I understood the theoretical implications of time complexity, it was hard to see its direct impact on real-world applications. It was not always clear how a difference in Big O notation would translate to actual performance differences in a running program, considering hardware and implementation details.</div>
        <div class="question">Determine the Best Possible Approach/Design Techniques: </div>
        <div class="answer"> I learned how to identify the dominant operations of an algorithm and apply the Big O rules to get the overall complexity. It taught me that there is always a time and space trade-off; one should select algorithms with the best fit for constraints and expected input sizes in the given problem. In such cases where memory was a big issue, I would go with the in-place algorithm, even if it had a slightly higher time complexity.</div>
        <div class="question">My Code Example:</div>
        <div class="code">
            <pre>
                function exampleFunction(n) {
                    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                            // Some constant time operation
                            console.log(i * j);
                        }
                    }
                }

  <h2>Arrays/Hash Maps</h2>
  <div class="question">Challenges in Understanding:</div>
  <div class="answer">With arrays, it was sometimes difficult to keep in mind that they are of fixed size and what that means for insertions and deletions. In the case of Hash Maps, it was a bit challenging to fully understand how hash functions actually work and how collisions are handled—e.g., chaining or open addressing.</div>
  <div class="question">Real-World Application Challenges:</div>
  <div class="answer">In real-world applications, the choice between arrays and hash maps depends heavily on the use case. Should fast lookups by key be required, then a hash map is the excellent choice. If there is a need to preserve order or iterate through elements in a particular sequence, then an array or a sorted array may be more fitting. Dealing with very large datasets which do not fit in memory can be quite problematic for both.</div>
  <div class="question">Most Efficient Approach:</div>
  <div class="answer">For lookups by key, hash maps (with a good hash function and collision handling) provide O(1) average time complexity, which is very efficient. For ordered data or when index-based access is important, arrays are the better choice.</div>

  <h2>Pattern Printing</h2>
  <div class="question">Challenges in Understanding:</div>
  <div class="answer">It was hard in the beginning to translate a desired pattern into nested loops and conditional statements. It took practice to figure out the right loop boundaries and the logic for printing spaces and characters.</div>
  <div class="question">Real-World Application Challenges:</div>
  <div class="answer">While pattern printing itself may not be directly applicable in most real-world applications, the underlying logic of nested loops and conditional statements is central to many programming tasks, such as data processing, image manipulation, and game development.</div>
  <div class="question">Most Efficient Approach:</div>
  <div class="answer">The most efficient approach would be to carefully analyze the pattern and break it down into smaller, repeatable parts. Then, iterate through rows and columns with nested loops, and use conditional statements to determine what to print at each position.</div>
</div>

<div class="concept">
  <h2>Pointers</h2>
  <div class="question">Challenges in Understanding:</div>
  <div class="answer">It was hard to understand how memory addresses work and how pointers store and manipulate them in the beginning. The same goes for the issues related to pointer arithmetic, null pointers, and dangling pointers.</div>
  <div class="question">Real-World Application Challenges:</div>
  <div class="answer">Pointers are a key in languages such as C or C++, in dealing with dynamic memory management, implementing data structures like linked lists, and optimization of performance. However, they can also sometimes be a source of bugs if not used carefully. In higher-level languages such as Java and Python, the concept of pointers has been abstracted away, though understanding how that works underneath may prove advantageous.</div>
  <div class="question">Most Efficient Approach:</div>
  <div class="answer">Using pointers correctly and cautiously is key. Always initialize pointers, avoid dereferencing null or dangling pointers, and use them judiciously to optimize performance or implement specific data structures.</div>
<div class="question">My Code:</div>
  <div class="code">
            <pre>#include&lt;iostream&gt;

  <h2>Stack</h2>
  <div class="question">Challenges in Understanding:</div>

  <div class="question">Real-World Application Challenges:</div>
  <div class="answer">Stacks are heavily used in real-world applications; for example, in function call management, expression evaluation, and undo/redo functionality in software applications.</div>
  <div class="question">Most Efficient Approach:</div>

  <div class="answer">It is challenging to measure the time and space complexity of a program in real-world applications because of the hardware, the operating system, and all the other processes running.
